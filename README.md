The three leading causes of fatalities in today's world are heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. This frequently results in persistent illnesses that have negative effects on quality of life. The methods provided attempt to identify key traits by utilizing ML techniques, enhancing the accuracy of disease prediction. While both Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are used for all three diseases, results reveal that Logistic Regression yields a promising accuracy of 91.4% for heart disease, while SVM demonstrates accuracy levels of 96.2% for diabetes and 87.1% for Parkinson's disease. Additionally, an intuitive web application has been developed to facilitate user interaction. The integrated prediction system enhances early disease identification for proactive healthcare management.

In the context of healthcare challenges, specifically delayed medical care, this project utilizes patient health data and advanced machine learning techniques.
It utilizes three models to predict Diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and Heart disease early, aiding high-risk individuals. 
The investigation involves diverse classification algorithms, utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression for all three conditions.
Significantly, SVM yields remarkable testing accuracy for Parkinson's disease and diabetes datasets, while logistic regression demonstrates promising outcomes for the heart disease dataset.
A user-friendly web application is created via Python's framework, integrating Streamlit, Pickle for frontend and model use, and scikit-learn for efficient training. 

1. Parkinson's Disease:   
	- A neurodegenerative disorder. 
	- Impacts movement control due to dopamine deficiency. 
	- Symptoms include tremors, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity.
	- No cure, but managed with medication and therapy.

2. Heart Disease:
	- Cardiovascular condition affecting the heart and blood vessels. 
	- Risk factors: High blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, obesity.   
	- Types include coronary artery disease and heart failure.
	- Prevented through a healthy lifestyle and managed with medication and surgery.
3. Diabetes:  
                  - A metabolic disorder affecting blood sugar regulation.
                  - Complications include heart disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy.   
                  - Managed through diet, exercise, medication, or insulin.
# Diabetes Disease Dataset:
The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The dataset consists of 100000 rows and 8 columns.

Heart Disease Dataset:
The dataset come from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of the dataset of US residents with 319794 rows and 12 columns.

Parkinson’s Disease Dataset:
This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals. There are around six recordings per patient. The dataset consists of 195 rows and 10 columns.

An integrated machine learning approach enhances disease prediction precision for heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease using diverse datasets. Logistic regression shows high accuracy in heart disease prediction, while support vector machines yield promising results for diabetes and Parkinson's disease. This system swiftly identifies vulnerable individuals, aiding timely interventions. A user-friendly web application enables personalized risk prediction, promoting proactive health management. Overall, this study underscores machine learning's significance in healthcare for improved patient care.
